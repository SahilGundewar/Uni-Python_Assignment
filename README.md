📘 Python Class Assignment (Semester 2)

This repository contains my Semester 2 Python class assignments, submitted as part of academic coursework.
Each program demonstrates core Python concepts such as data structures and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Q_2.py	Sets	Common set operations and methods
Q_3.py	Tuples	Tuple operations including slicing and nesting
Q_4.py	Dictionaries	Dictionary CRUD operations + merge
Q_5.py	OOP	Bank class using Object-Oriented Programming
Q_6.py	OOP	Library class using Object-Oriented Programming
Q_7.py	OOP	Multiple Inheritance (Person, Employee → Manager)
Q_8.py	OOP	Polymorphism using Vehicle, Car, Bicycle
Q_9.py	Modules	User-defined module shapes.py for area calculations
✅ Concepts Covered
🔹 Q1 – List Operations (Q_1.py)

Demonstrates:

Creating and accessing list elements

Adding elements using append()

Removing elements using remove()

Sorting using sort()

Reversing using reverse()

🔹 Q2 – Set Operations (Q_2.py)

Demonstrates:

Creating sets

Union and intersection of sets

Adding elements using add()

Removing elements using remove()

🔹 Q3 – Tuple Operations (Q_3.py)

Demonstrates:

Creating and accessing tuple elements

Tuple concatenation

Repetition of tuples

Slicing operations

Nested tuples

🔹 Q4 – Dictionary Operations (Q_4.py)

Demonstrates:

Creating and accessing key-value pairs

Adding and deleting items

Updating dictionary values

Merging two dictionaries

🔹 Q5 – Bank Class (OOP) (Q_5.py)

Demonstrates:

Class & object creation

Constructor usage

Deposit and withdrawal methods

Balance checking

Displaying account information

🔹 Q6 – Library Class (OOP) (Q_6.py)

Demonstrates:

Book availability management

Checkout and return system

Displaying available book details

🆕 New Questions Added
🔹 Q7 – Multiple Inheritance (Q_7.py)

Demonstrates:

Multiple Inheritance using two parent classes

Person class storing name and age

Employee class storing employee_id and salary

Manager class inheriting from both and adding department

Calling constructors of both parent classes

Displaying combined details using inherited methods

🔹 Q8 – Polymorphism (Q_8.py)

Demonstrates:

Polymorphism using method overriding

Base class Vehicle containing method move()

Derived classes:

Car overriding move() → prints "Driving on the road"

Bicycle overriding move() → prints "Pedaling on the road"

Same method behaves differently for different objects

🔹 Q9 – User Defined Module (Q_9.py + shapes.py)

Demonstrates:

Creating a user-defined module named shapes.py

Functions included:

Area of circle

Area of rectangle

Area of triangle

Importing module using import shapes

Taking user input and calculating area based on choice

Clean code reuse with external module
